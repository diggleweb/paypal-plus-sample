This is a simple example of PayPal-Plus Checkout.

PayPal PLUS is a solution where PayPal offers PayPal, Credit Card, Direct Debit (ELV) and pay upon invoice as individual payment options on the payment selection page. The available payment methods are provided in a PayPal hosted iframe. 

Based on the payment method selected by the buyer, he will at a later stage (on redirect to PayPal / in context checkout) be presented with either the PayPal Login page or an input mask for bank / credit card details or a pay upon invoice details page.

The redirect can be initiated from within the iframe or at any later stage during checkout. 
The final payment execution happens on the merchant side.
